Exploring the design space of deep CNN at large scale// ref:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06519.pdf
Abstract:
  motivation: there is no exists a specific CNN architecture that can solved all problems optimally, instead proper CNN quite depend on   tasks, so an methodology that enables systematic exploration of a design space of CNN is a meritorious work.
  details: this work is comprised of 4 themes:1)chosing benchmarks; 2)train CNN models; 3)defining, describing CNN design space; 4) Exploring the desing space of CNN architectures.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Motivation
  machine learning: enable the computer to automatically learn whithout explicitly being programmed. 
  motivating the search for right deep cnn architecture: since 2012, the best performance on many problems of computer vision are achieved by deep CNNs and a single DNN configuration is not able to singlehandedly sovle all problems.
